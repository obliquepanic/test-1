<p class="small-text"><i>Braille Suite,</i> 2006, from <i>Regeneration,</i> is included in the exhibition <i>The Human Touch: Making Art, Leaving Traces</i> at The Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, January 6th - May 3rd, 2021.</p>
<p class="small-text">A fully illustrated catalogue is available from the museum.		
	
<p class="heading1">Catalogue quotations: </p>
<p class="small-text">"Despite the documentary import of photography, these are not specimens that have emerged from the deepest oceans or furthest forests: they are creations from within the artist's mind realised through the transforming properties of light.  Their creation shares a deeper metaphor with Anna Atkins' algae cyanotypes (&hellip;.) A biometric realisation, in that art imitates the processes of life to create new forms."</p>
<p class="heading1">Craig Hartley, 2016.  (extract discussing Evidence of Doubt, from his catalogue essay for Realisation: recent works by Susan Aldworth and Jane Dixon)  Published by The Fitzwilliam Museum, 2016.</p>
<p class="small-text"> "On a more universal scale, meanwhile, the body is what we must live within.  As we're reminded by Jane Dixon's intensely worked Untitled (Torso Diptych) 1997 - a near abstract study in bulging flesh - the body is the imperfect frame wherein consciousness pulses (&hellip;)." </p>
<p class="heading1">Martin Herbert, 2016 (extract from his essay in Drawn from Life: People on Paper.)  Hayward Publishing, 2016.</p>
<p class="small-text">At the heart of Jane Dixon's work is a complex creative process that, perhaps uniquely, inverts the usual hierarchy, in that here a painting is made solely to play a part in the creation of a drawing (&hellip;) &nbsp;The resulting drawings are (&hellip;) thought provoking works of art, which carry a considerable burden of symbolism. <br>
<p class="heading1">Susan Owens, 2013 (extract from The Art of Drawing: British Masters and Methods since 1600.&nbsp; V&amp;A publishing)</p>
<p class="small-text">&quot;For me, the most affecting drawings are those which are peculiar and lucid (....) In this selection one finds such distinct 'handwriting': the very built up coloured dots and clear script in Alison Turnbull's chart, the muted drifts within passges by David Musgrave, Don Brown, Emma McNally, George Shaw, Jane Dixon or Alison Wilding, all of whom think with shading, razor cuts, frottage, transparencies and employ techniques that deliberately lose their eloquence in reproduction.&quot;</p>
<span class="heading1">Catherine Lampert, 2009 (extract from the catalogue essay for In Between the Lines: <em>Recent British Drawings,</em> Trinity Contemporary, London.)</span>
</p>
<p class="small-text">&quot;What interests me is that you are able to produce
  images that appear calm out of such intensity or violence, yet that remain
  threatening. It is that sense of vulnerability combined with a troubling
  vitality that is fascinatng because so fragile, as if you have caught a
  moment of tension or poise between two such opposing states.&quot;</p>
<p class="heading1">Simon Groom in conversation with Jane Dixon for the catalogue
  to accompany the exhibition 'Solid Sate: reflections upon the real' which
  she exhibited in and curated for Kettles' Yard, Cambridge in 2001. </p>
<p class="small-text">&quot;Her work is about vulnerability. It is about the human
  body, although the body is almost never present. It adresses the fears
  and sensations that the body engenders and arouses. Her paintings map
  the extent of our fragility and articulate the sensation of containment
  within fallible, organic, imperfect bodies. They speak eloquently of
  simple but important truths: of our need to hide our failings, to protect
  our weakness: they negotiate fundamental human paranoias - medical invasion,
  decrepitude, the threat of violence - and our fear of what is inevitable.&quot;</p>
<p class="heading1">Ben Tufnell, curator at Tate Britain (taken from <em>Under
  False Colours,</em> 2004) </p>
